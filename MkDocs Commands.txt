cd folder

mkdocs serve
#Serves the mkdocs project in CD to IP http://127.0.0.1:8000 

mkdocs build
#Builds the website onto local file "site"

git checkout Testing_1
#First, checkout your documentation files onto the github repository.

mkdocs gh-deploy
#Then, gh-deploys builds the website "site" files onto the github branch "gh-pages"

Notes:
You should use .gitignore to not send the "site" files onto the "master" branch on github, since those files will be built into the branch "gh-pages"
